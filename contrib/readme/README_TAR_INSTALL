Guide to setup API Broker using setup.sh
====================================

IGNORE THIS IF YOU INSTALLED API Broker FROM THE SHELL.

------------------
If you try to install API Broker from a tar distribution, setup.sh can help you
to set environment for normal API Broker operations.

Steps:
1. Go to the directory where you untared (probably you already there)
2. run setup.sh [api_broker_home]


Example1
========

$ download API-BROKER-1.0.0.0022-0b9a9e0-Linux.x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar xvf API-BROKER-1.0.0.0022-0b9a9e0-Linux.x86_64.tar.gz
$ cd API-BROKER
$ sh share/scripts/setup.sh

Example2
========
$ download API-BROKER-1.0.0.0022-0b9a9e0-Linux.x86_64.tar.gz
$ tar xvf API-BROKER-1.0.0.0022-0b9a9e0-Linux.x86_64.tar.gz
$ sh API-BROKER/share/scripts/setup.sh API-BROKER

Then, depending on the shell you are using, either .api-broker.sh or .api-broker.csh will be
created in your home directory. That scripts includes modification of PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
environment variables required for the API Broker.

Futhermore, to execute the api-broker shell script (.api-broker.sh or .api-broker.csh) at the login time,
one of .bash_profile, .profile, .cshrc, and .zshrc will be modified.
